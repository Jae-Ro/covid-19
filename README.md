# A Dataset of Covid-19 Tweets Surrounding Face Masks for Sentiment Analysis
Corona Virus Twitter Analysis

The goal of this study is to expand upon the research done by Chen et. al in gathering Twitter data related to COVID-19 by more specifically analyzing COVID-19 Tweets surrounding the topic of face masks. Are face masks helpful in preventing one from catching the virus? Should face masks be worn by non-healthcare professionals? Are face masks going to help decrease the spread of this virus on a public health level? These types of questions have been floating around throughout the past few months. As a result, through this study we attempt to
1) Create a Twitter dataset containing tweets related to face masks and COVID-19, 2) Observe high-level trends in tweets within this dataset, and 3) Analyze public sentiment about face masks (and its potential shift) amidst this pandemic over time.
